# VBA-challenge

1. First, I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  -The ticker symbol

  -Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the      end of that year.

  -The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price     at the end of that year.
  
2. Added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

3. I ran my script on every worksheet (every year) at once.
